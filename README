# Normalization


[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger)

Normalization is a data mining technique of data transformation. This package involves 3 methods which can easily be used just by abiding the filename and column name as the parameters, usage example is described at the later section of this description file. The functions included in this library are as follows.

  - Min_max_nor
  - zscore_nor
  - decimal_nor



### Example: -
* normalization.required_method('__filename__, __column_name1__ , column_name2 ,....')
* normalization.min_max_nor('iris.csv', 'sepalwidth', 'sepallength')
* normalization.zscore_nor('iris.csv', 'sepalwidth')
* normalization.decimal_nor('iris.csv', 'sepalwidth')

### Install Dependencies
Normalization uses a some of open source library to work properly:
  
          1. numpy
          2. array
          3. random
          4. statistics
          5. pandas

And of course Normalization itself is open source with a [MIT Lisence]
 on GitHub.
